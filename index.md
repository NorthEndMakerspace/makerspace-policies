## Households

All paid memberships encompass your whole household, with some stipulations. Household means all people with the same physical address, and additional key-holding household members will need to complete a one-time background check ($39). You can add household members to your account [in your member profile in Wild Apricot](https://nem.wildapricot.org/Sys/Profile).

## Minors

Keyholders must be 18 or older. Guardians must chaperone minors at all times. Household minors do not require a guest pass, but may not have their own key. Any trained tools (such as a woodshop or laser cutter) would require training, as well as guardian consent to use, and may have age limits depending on their relative danger. All attendees of any age must be vaccinated.

## Tool Time

The Badger automatically tracks tool time on most equipment except the Wazer. If you use the Wazer or encounter a malfunctioning Badger, please notify the IT team on Discord (<span class="stewards-handle">@it_team</span>). Usually, Badgers reconnect on their own, but if they don’t and it is bypassed, record your time using the provided form:

[Log your tool time](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScYAjpR1PtrgCwTFzeEzlRUibw8yqn0aM1zNIIzgTkiSsiPvQ/viewform)

Tracking usage helps us schedule maintenance. Learn more about tool time [here](https://nemakers.notion.site/Timed-Tool-Info-Status-1c3f8d7fdd8f4eec998d1ed3bd7d673d?pvs=143).

## Pets

For safety reasons, only service animals are permitted in our space. Areas such as the woodshop have elevated noise levels and limited space, which can pose challenges and risks for both members and service animals. If a member with a service animal needs to access the woodshop and is concerned about these conditions, our facilities team is available to help arrange a safe and accommodating time for use. Ensuring a secure and accessible environment is our priority.

## Member storage

- Do not leave your tools, consumables, etc. in the common areas of the makerspace.
- There are a limited number of storage cubbies for members to store belongings.
- There are a limited number of project shelves and tall storage cubbies available for short-term use.

For more information, see: [How do I store things at NEM?](https://nemakers.notion.site/How-do-I-store-things-at-NEM-2dff0d9602108087a034d1fdd6313255?pvs=143).

## Food/Drink

All food stored in the refrigerator or cabinets must be labeled with your name, contact information, and the current date. Unlabeled items may be used by any member. Expired dry food, as well as refrigerated food kept for more than a week, will be discarded to maintain cleanliness and safety.

## Guest Policy

All guests must sign a waiver ([nems.link/waiver](https://nems.link/waiver)) before doing anything at the space. Your guests are your responsibility – as a member, _you are responsible_ that they:

- Act in accordance with all makerspace policies.
- Follow all safety rules.
- Only use tools they are trained to use.
- Clean it up after themselves.
- Behave respectfully to others and act in accordance with our [community standards and code of conduct](https://northendmakers.org/conduct.php).

## Key Fob Replacement

You may purchase a replacement key fob for $5. Please post to the [#help-i-need-somebody](https://discord.com/channels/775417143029661748/1149882874003202048){: .discord-channel} channel on our Discord Server ([nems.link/discord](https://nems.link/discord)) or email [membership@northendmakers.org](mailto:membership@northendmakers.org?subject=Key%20Fob%20Replacement) to let us know that you have lost your fob so it can be deactivated.

## Voting Rights

Voting rights are on specific board decisions ([per our bylaws](https://nems.link/docs)) and come into effect after either a year of monthly membership or paying one year at once.

## Contribute

We are 100% volunteer-run. All members are part of the North End Makers community and expected to take part in the upkeep of the space and community.

## Space-specific Policies

Individual rooms within the space have additional policies above the global policies outlined above. Please reach out to the stewards on Discord if you have any questions or concerns.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

{% assign sorted_pages = site.pages | sort:"order" %}
{% for page in sorted_pages -%}
{% if page.dir == "/area/" -%}

- [{{ page.title }}]({{ page.url | relative_url }})
{% endif -%}
{% endfor %}
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Repeated failure to adhere to any of the policies outlined under this policy document may result in the revocation of membership privileges.

Remember that this is a shared space, treat it like you live here.

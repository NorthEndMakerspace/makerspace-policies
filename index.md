# Households

All paid memberships encompass your whole household, with some stipulations. Household means all people with the same physical address, and additional key-holding household members will need to complete a one-time background check ($39). You can add household members to your account [in your member profile in Wild Apricot](https://nem.wildapricot.org/Sys/Profile).

# Minors

Keyholders must be 18 or older. Guardians must chaperone minors at all times. Household minors do not require a guest pass, but may not have their own key. Any trained tools (such as a woodshop or laser cutter) would require training, as well as guardian consent to use, and may have age limits depending on their relative danger. All attendees of any age must be vaccinated.

# Tool Time

The Badger automatically tracks tool time on most equipment except the Wazer. If you use the Wazer or encounter a malfunctioning Badger, please notify the IT team on Discord (<span class="stewards-handle">@it\_team</span>). Usually, Badgers reconnect on their own, but if they don’t and it is bypassed, record your time using the provided form. Tracking usage helps us schedule maintenance. Learn more about tool time here.

# Pets

For safety reasons, only service animals are permitted in our space. Areas such as the woodshop have elevated noise levels and limited space, which can pose challenges and risks for both members and service animals. If a member with a service animal needs to access the woodshop and is concerned about these conditions, our facilities team is available to help arrange a safe and accommodating time for use. Ensuring a secure and accessible environment is our priority.

# Member storage

* Use member cubbies to store your tools, consumables, etc. Do not store food outside of the kitchen.
* Label all material and projects with **your name**, **your contact informatio**n, and **today’s date**.
  * If possible, use the project storage shelves.
  * If you must leave material outside of project storage, ensure it is out of the way and does not impede usage of any tool or work space.
* Unlabelled material in the scrap bin or labelled material/projects older than 1 week are free for any member to use.

# Food/Drink

All food stored in the refrigerator or cabinets must be labeled with your name, contact information, and the current date. Unlabeled items may be used by any member. Expired dry food, as well as refrigerated food kept for more than a week, will be discarded to maintain cleanliness and safety.

# Guest Policy

All guests must sign a waiver ([nems.link/waiver](https://nems.link/waiver)) before doing anything at the space. Your guests are your responsibility – as a member, *you are responsible* if they:

* Make a mess and don’t clean it up
* Use tools they are not trained to use.
* Behave disrespectfully to others
* Do not follow safety rules.

# Key Fob Replacement

You may purchase a replacement key fob for $5. Please post to the [#help-i-need-sombody](https://discord.com/channels/775417143029661748/1149882874003202048){: .discord-channel} channel on [our Discord Server](https://nems.link/discord) or email **membership@northendmakers.org** to let us know that you have lost your fob so it can be deactivated.

# Voting Rights

Voting rights are on specific board decisions ([per our bylaws](https://nems.link/docs)) and come into effect after either a year of monthly membership or paying one year at once.

# Contribute

We are 100% volunteer-run. All members are part of the North End Makers community and expected to take part in the upkeep of the space and community.

# Space-specific Policies

Individual rooms within the space have additional policies above the global policies outlined above. Please reach out to the stewards on Discord if you have any questions or concerns.

{% assign sorted_pages = site.pages | sort:"order" %}
{% for page in sorted_pages -%}
{% if page.dir == "/area/" -%}
- [{{ page.title }}]({{ page.url }})
{% endif -%}
{% endfor %}

Repeated failure to adhere to any of the policies outlined under this policy document may result in the revocation of membership privileges.

Remember that this is a shared space, treat it like you live here.

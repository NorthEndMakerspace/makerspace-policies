- Do not leave a soldering iron or power supply running unattended.
- Keep the work area dry and clear of liquid containers that may spill.
- Try to limit your project to 24 V.
  - You can use up to 48 V with low current (≤10 mA).
  - Contact <span class="stewards-handle">{{ page.stewards }}</span> in the Discord for approval of higher voltage/current projects.
- When working with moving parts (motors, servos, etc) you must ensure everyone in the room is wearing suitable eye protection and aware when your project is active.

## Before leaving

The woodshop is easily one of the biggest sources of dirt and noise in the Makerspace and houses some of the more potentially dangerous pieces of equipment. As such, additional policies apply to the use of that room to mitigate safety, cleanliness, and other concerns for the room itself and the larger space.

## Entering the woodshop:

1. **The wood shop and its tools require certification to use**. Woodshop training is offered on a tiered, regular basis to the best of the volunteer stewards’ ability.
2. **Dress appropriately for a woodshop**. Closed-toed shoes are required to enter. Do not wear loose clothing or dangling jewelry. Tie back long hair.
3. **Always use dust collection** when possible while using powered tools and turn on the wall mounted air filters when you enter the woodshop space. Instructions on how to activate these are provided during tool certifications.

## While using the woodshop:

1. **Wear safety-rated eye protection (ANSI Z87.1)** if *any* tool in the woodshop is in use. Personal corrective eyewear is not considered eye protection and does not fulfill this requirement, unless it is certified under ANSI Z87.1. We provide eye protection that members can use.
2. **Wear ear protection of at least 20dB NRR (ANSI S12.6)** if *any* tool that requires ear protection (or is louder than 85dB) is in use. Use the free [NIOSH Sound Level Meter App](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/noise/about/app.html) if you are unsure of the volume of a particular piece of equipment. We provide ear protection that members can use.
3. **Keep all doors closed** when any tools are in use. This is to mitigate noise and dirt propagation outside of the woodshop.
4. **Empty full dust collection bags** into the trash dumpster before continuing use. If they are more than 60% filled, they are considered “full”.
5. **Consider wearing a face mask** if you are creating a lot of dust. Your lungs will thank you.

## When leaving the woodshop, members are required to:

1. **Leave the air filter units on** with a timer for at least an hour.
2. **Return tools to where they were found**, including eye protection, shop vac, and chairs/stools.
3. **Reset tools to their storage states**, including the miter saw, table saw, etc., as outlined during the tool certification.
4. **Label any project left in the space** with your name, today’s date, and contact info (phone number and/or Discord handle). Maximum storage period is 1 week.
5. **Clear all work surfaces** of trash, sawdust, tools, and projects. Sawdust from your work can end up outside your immediate working area.
6. **Sweep and/or vacuum the entire floor** clear of sawdust and trash.
7. **Close and lock all windows**, if you are the last one out. Note that someone before you may have opened them.

## Allowed materials:

* Wood \- All tools
* Soft metals \- drill press w/ lubricant, files
* Plastics \- Drill press, band saw

If you have offcuts that you would like to donate to the scrap bin please use the gauge graphic next to the scrap bin as a guideline as to whether the piece is large enough to qualify for the scrap bin. If the piece is smaller than the gauge graphic please place it in the trash bin instead.

## If you see something, say something:

* If the woodshop is not left in a clean state, please let us know.
* Members should feel empowered to remind each other about the requirements around PPE when co-working in the woodshop. These are required, not optional, when certain pieces of equipment are in use.

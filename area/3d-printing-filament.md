3D printing with extruded filament is generally safe but care should be taken to ensure your print succeeds and the printers and filament remains in good condition for the next person.

## General rules

- Printing with filament requires the 3D filament printing certification.
- Ensure the first two layers adhere properly before leaving the makerspace.

- TODO:
  - Which filaments are allowed?
  - Does MMU require extra training?
  - Can folks use their own filament?
  - Can folks use the dryer on their own filament?

## FAQ

- Currently, we do not reclaim or recycle filament scraps or remnants (the last bit of a spool). If you find a tangled or unspooled filament roll, do not use it; place it in a bag, tuck it away in a drawer, and notify the stewards on Discord.
- Filament rolls that are not being used on a printer must be returned to the filament shelves in a plastic bag with a desiccant pack.
- Print beds should be thoroughly cleaned with isopropyl alcohol and wipes before and after each use.
  - If your print is having trouble adhering, try cleaning the bed with mild detergent (e.g. dish soap) in the sink and dry thoroughly before replacing.
- Finished prints left on printers can be removed and placed in the Finished Print Bin on the window shelf. If you want your print not to be taken because you are in or near the space, please place a note on it.

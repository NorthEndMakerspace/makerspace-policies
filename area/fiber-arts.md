## General rules

- Discard scraps smaller than 1 sq ft
- Scissor must only be used on fabric or thread
- TODO does fiber arts accept donations?

## Sewing machines

- When cleaning up, leave the bobbin in the sewing machine but put away the spool.
- The [industrial sewing machine (Juki LU-562)](https://nemakers.notion.site/Juki-LU-562-industrial-sewing-machine-194f0d96021080d6a8f3c34bf081433e) requires special training to use.
- The [computerized embroidery machine (Husqvarna)](https://nemakers.notion.site/Husqvarna-Viking-Designer-Diamond-DeLuxe-embroidery-machine-e5ccd2278ec64723a46195feeb3258c5) does not require certification. It operates similarly to a normal sewing machine, but has additional steps to set up materials and digitize designs.

## Sergers

- When cleaning up, leave the serger threaded and ready for use.

Cutting with either laser cutter requires the laser cutter certification. The async learning module ([Laser 101 - Learn @ NEM](https://learn.northendmakers.org/course/view.php?id=2)) must be completed before certification.

## Disallowed materials

**Never** cut any of the following materials on the laser, as they pose a safety risk when cut.

- **PVC** (Poly Vinyl Chloride, e.g. vinyl/pleather/artificial leather): emits pure chlorine gas
- **Polycarbonate/Lexan** thicker than 1mm: cuts poorly, discolors, catches fire
- **ABS**: emits cyanide gas
- **HDPE** (e.g. milk bottle plastic): catches fire, melts
- **Polystyrene foam**: #1 cause of laser fires!
- **Polypropylene foam**: catches fire
- **Fiberglass**: emits noxious fumes
- **Coated carbon fiber**: emits noxious fumes

If you are not sure what your material is, **do not cut it on the laser**.

## While using

- You must be 18 or older to use the lasers.
- Children must be supervised and not allowed to peek into the laser at edges while the laser is running.
- **Always be within arm’s reach of the E-Stop buttons.**

### In case of fire

If the air nozzle does not put out the fire immediately:

1. Stop the laser with the E-Stop.
1. Push the carriage out of the way.
1. Smother the fire with fire blanket.
1. **As a last resort**, use fire extinguisher.

- TODO
  - what to do when the pin (?) is out of alignment
  - How to run air filter?
  - When and how to store scrap?

## Before leaving

Remember to clean up any waste generated by your cut. The rules in [All areas]({% link area/all-areas.md %}) apply.

Don't forget your USB drive/SD card!

## What to do if Wazer isn't cutting

If the nozzle on the Wazer gets clogged. You'll get an interrupted cut line. When that happens:

- Pull out the abrasives tube to see if the water has infiltrated it, and if it has, try to clear out the clog and allow the hose to dry.
- You can also spray out the nozzle before restarting.

## Before leaving:

Clean out the used abrasives tub into the kitty litter tubs on the deck and leave upside down on the cutting surface.

Remember to clean up any waste generated by your cut. The rules in [All areas]({% link area/all-areas.md %}) apply.

Don't forget your USB drive/SD card!

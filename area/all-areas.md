These rules apply to all areas, including the common areas. Each specific area may have additional rules for safety and cleanliness.

## General rules:

- Materials (scraps, screws, thread, 3D filament, electronic components, etc.) may only leave the makerspace when used in a project.
- Consumables (sandpaper, tape, solder, etc) must be used at the makerspace.
- Tools must stay in the makerspace.
  - If you need a tool for a project off-site, please consider the NE Seattle Tool Library or Shoreline Tool Library as a resource for borrowing equipment, [Seattle REconomy](https://seattlereconomy.org/).
  - You may bring and use your own tools if they are on the approved list:
    - Hand tools
    - Dremel
    - Soldering iron
    - Ask a steward if you are unsure
- Always wear appropriate PPE while working.
- Loans and donations of tools/consumables must have steward approval. Leaving a tool in a common space is considered a loan and requires steward approval.
- If a tool is not working propery (inoperable, running unusually or unsafely, etc), inform a steward (in person, or on our [Discord server](https://nems.link/discord)) or make a post in the [#help-i-need-somebody](https://discord.com/channels/775417143029661748/1149882874003202048){: .discord-channel} channel.

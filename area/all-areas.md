These rules apply to all areas, including the common areas. Each specific area may have additional rules for safety and cleanliness.

## General rules:

* Materials (scraps, screws, thread, 3D filament, electronic components, etc.) may only leave the makerspace when used in a project.
* Consumables (sandpaper, tape, solder, etc) must be used at the makerspace.
* Tools must stay in the makerspace.
  * If you need a tool for a project off-site, please consider the NE Seattle Tool Library or Shoreline Tool Library as a resource for borrowing equipment, [Seattle REconomy](https://seattlereconomy.org/).
  * You may bring and use your own tools if they are on the approved list:
    * Hand tools
    * Dremel
    * Soldering iron
    * Ask a steward if you are unsure
* Always wear appropriate PPE while working.
* Loans/donations of tools/consumables must have steward approval. Leaving a tool in a common space is considered a loan and requires steward approval.
* If a tool is not working propery (inoperable, running unusually or unsafely, etc), inform a steward (in person, or on our [Discord server](https://nems.link/discord)) or make a post in the [#help-i-need-somebody](https://discord.com/channels/775417143029661748/1149882874003202048){: .discord-channel} channel.

## Before leaving, clean up for the next person:

* Return tools and unused consumables back to where your found them
* Clear your workspace of any projects, tools, and trash
* Sweep/vacuum the floor when you have left debris such as sawdust or fabric scraps on the floor.
* Empty trash bins in the building trash room if more than half full.
* **Ensure any windows or outside doors you've opened are closed and locked.**
  * Double-check that the windows are latched and do not open.
  * If you are the last one out of the space, check:
    * Both windows in the woodshop.
    * The window in the main common space.
    * The patio door in the main common space.
    * The back patio door in the Wazer room.

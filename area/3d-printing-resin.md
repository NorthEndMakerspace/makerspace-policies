The resins used in 3D printing are toxic and considered harmful from both skin contact and inhalation of fumes. Care must be taken to limit one's exposure to resin and contain it and its fumes inside of the resin tent. The UV lights used to cure prints can be damaging to your eyes if used improperly.

## General rules

- Printing with resin requires the 3D resin printing certification.
- **The resin tent door must be zipped closed** unless you're entering or leaving the tent.

## While inside the tent:

- You must wear gloves.
- You must wear a respirator rated for organic vapors (black 3M cartridge).
- All uncured materials must stay inside the tent.
- Use the tent’s trash can for all waste from handling and cleaning.

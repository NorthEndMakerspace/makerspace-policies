Printing with resin requires the 3D resin printing certification.

- **The resin tent door must be zipped closed** unless you're entering or leaving the tent.
- While inside the tent:
  - You must wear glove.
  - You must wear a respirator rated for organic vapors (black 3M cartridge).
- All uncured materials must stay inside the tent.
- Use the tent’s trash can for all waste from handling and cleaning.
